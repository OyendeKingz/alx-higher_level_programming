## Warm up

#Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. In this project we will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
	`Scripting` Same as Python
	`Web front-end'
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
